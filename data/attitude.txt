Understanding people's stances and stance towards controversial issues has been of great interest to the Social Sciences and Natural Language Processing (NLP) communities. 

Previous work on stance classification in NLP has mostly focused on determining a user's stance towards \textit{each controversial issue independently}. However, as shown by prior studies in Social Sciences, a user's stance on a particular controversial issue is not necessarily independent of their stance on other controversial issues. 
Therefore, we hypothesize that treating stance classification as a multitask classification problem would allow us to leverage the similarities between different controversial issues. In this paper, we first use an embedding-based method to determine the similarity between the controversial issues. 

We then experiment with different multitask setups using top k most similar controversial issues as auxiliary tasks. We show that using auxiliary tasks in a multitask setup for classifying the stance consistently performs better than predicting stance for each issue separately. We further find that using a small group of auxiliary tasks achieves the optimal performance, highlighting the importance of selecting only the most similar controversial issues as the auxiliary tasks.
